# CCLUB Snack System
This is a flask-based site to replace the current snack system.  
## How does it work?
This system will utilize Flask, Flask-Login, and Flask-SQLAlchemy to serve a web page, set up a card-based login system, and store necessary data respectively.  We used [dking986's example](https://github.com/dking986/Flask-Basic-Login) to build this using Flask.
## How to set up
* Install Python3
* run the script below in either power shell(for windows users) or the terminal(Mac and Linux users)
```sh
python -m pip install Flask Flask-Login Flask-SQLAlchemy
```
* Finally, run the script below in order to start up your local web server.  Note that you will have to do this every time you want to start up your service.
```sh
python app.py
```
## TODO
We need to design a login page, as well as rounding out all of the data that will be used on the backend.
